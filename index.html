          Web design has come a long way. It started with just text and symbols then moved to tables. Then came a period of time dominated by <em>Javascript and Flash</em>. Since the adoption of CSS it seem that the changes have been more conceptual than trying to move
          away from the <em>HTML and CSS </em> combination. The future holds promisses of minimize type spent actually typing code and shifting focus to problem solving.

          Web design started with the simplest of design black background and green text. Thankfully, in 1995 the web browser was created. The problem then became that html had only one real option to communicate with the browser which was tables. The problem with
          tables is that they are designed for numbers and are not suited for other content. The introduction of Javascript and Flash seemed to promise many things but ultimately CSS came out on top. With the addition of frame works and grids as well
          as conceptual changes <em>HTML and CSS</em> continue to be the major build blocks of modern web pages.

          The future looks very exciting for web design. It promisses a shift from focusing on typing code to problem solving and design. The eventual goal being moving items around a screen and having clean code output.
